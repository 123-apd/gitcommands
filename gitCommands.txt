	// Make folder / repo
git init project1
cd project1
ls
ls-al

	// Command overview
git

	To "unversion" a repo => just delete the .git folder in the repo...

	//Ask git what it thinks about the current directory => checks 
	folder and subfolders for changes and new files	
	
git status
	=> nothing added to commit, but untracked file present
	
	// Add to version control. GIT ADD is merely a suggestion to participate in the next
	transactional action. Not yet a permanent record to the file
git add first.txt
git status
	=> new file: gitCommands.txt

git commit -m "my first commit"
	=> this file is now a permanent part of version control
git status
